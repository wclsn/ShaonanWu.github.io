Hello, and welcome to my personal website! My name is Shaonan Wu, and I am a senior undergraduate student from [College of Artificial Intelligence](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). Currently in my final year of undergraduate studies, I am passionate about exploring the fascinating field of artificial intelligence.

Now I am also embarking on an exciting journey as a joint Ph.D. student at Microsoft Research Asiaï¼Œspecifically in the NLC (Natural Language Computing) group. I will be co-supervised by two distinguished advisors who bring complementary expertise and guidance to my research: [Dr. Nan Duan](https://nanduan.github.io/)  and [Dr. Ping Wei](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/pingwei)

Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to engage in various projects and activities that have nurtured my passion for AI. I am particularly interested in the applications of machine learning and natural language processing, and I look forward to deepening my knowledge and expertise in these areas as I pursue my Ph.D.

Now my research interests mainly include:
- Neural-Symbolic AI
- Auto Theorem Proving (ATP)
- Lean Theorem Prover
