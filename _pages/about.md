Hello, and welcome to my personal website! My name is Shaonan Wu, and I am a senior undergraduate student from [College of Artificial Intelligence](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). Currently in my final year of undergraduate studies, I am passionate about exploring the fascinating field of artificial intelligence.

I am thrilled to share that starting next year, I will be embarking on an exciting journey as a joint Ph.D. student at Microsoft Research Asiaï¼Œspecifically in the NLC (Natural Language Computing) group. I will be co-supervised by two distinguished advisors who bring complementary expertise and guidance to my research:
- [Dr. Nan Duan](https://nanduan.github.io/): a senior principal researcher and research manager of the Natural Language Computing group at Microsoft Research Asia
- [Dr. Ping Wei](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/pingwei): a highly experienced professor from the College of Artificial Intelligence at Xi'an Jiaotong University, specializing in machine learning and computer vision.

Working with both Dr. Nan Duan and Dr. Ping Wei has been an enriching experience. Their collective knowledge and perspectives have helped shape the direction of my research and provided valuable insights into the field of Artificial Intelligence. I am grateful for their mentorship and support throughout my academic journey.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to engage in various projects and activities that have nurtured my passion for AI. I am particularly interested in the applications of machine learning and natural language processing, and I look forward to deepening my knowledge and expertise in these areas as I pursue my Ph.D.
